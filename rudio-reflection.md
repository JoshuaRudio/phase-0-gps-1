#What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
* Before the GPS session, I found myself struggling with applying the concepts of 'clone', 'fetch', and 'merge' because prior to this session, those functions were fairly new to me. I was having trouble understanding how to keep local repos upto date with the GitHub repo and then merging branches locally.

#What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
* After having to use the three concepts I was struggling with, the GPS has given me a better understanding on how to keep everything current and how to properly update GitHub and the local repo.

#What questions did you ask your guide?
* I asked my guide what proper Git workflow looks like. I learned that depending on the work environment, there could be multiple branches being worked on which are in development, in testing, or is even live.

#What still confuses you about Git?
* I'm still having issues trying to imagine what GitHub looks like in a working environment. I would like to see how Git is used on a day-to-day basis in the industry.

#How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
* It was a little disappointing to learn that I was not paired for this GPS but I believe that overall, it was still a great experience. Just being able to write a task while someone is guiding and monitoring my work while giving advice really gives me confidence my work. It confirms that I am learning and am slowly, yet surely progressing.
